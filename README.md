# Terraform code for Microsoft Azure

This repository contains Terraform code for creating and managing resources in Microsoft Azure. The code uses the Azure provider for Terraform, which allows you to define and provision Azure resources using Terraform.

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-azure.git

2. Install Terraform by following the instructions in the Terraform documentation: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli.

3. Install the Azure CLI by following the instructions in the Azure CLI documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli.

4. Authenticate with Azure by running the following command:

      az login

5. Change into the directory containing the Terraform code:

      cd terraform-azure

6. Initialize the Terraform configuration by running:

      terraform init
    
    This will download the necessary provider plugins and set up the backend for storing state.

7. Review and modify the Terraform code as needed. 

8. Apply the Terraform configuration by running:

      terraform apply
    
    This will create the resources defined in the Terraform code. You will be prompted to confirm the changes before they are applied.

9. Cleaning Up
To destroy the resources created by the Terraform code, run:

      terraform destroy
    
    This will delete all resources created by the Terraform code. You will be prompted to confirm the destruction before it is carried out.
